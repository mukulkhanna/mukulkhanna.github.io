I'm an ML Engineer at Waymo. Previously, I was an MS student at Georgia Tech advised by [Prof. Dhruv Batra](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dbatra/), working on computer vision and embodied AI research. I was also an ML intern with Apple's ï£¿ Vision Products Group over spring and summer of 2024, and before that have had the privilege of working closely with [Prof. Manolis Savva](https://msavva.github.io/) and [Prof. Angel Chang](https://angelxuanchang.github.io/) at Simon Fraser University. 

In a distant past, I have also had the privilege of interning at the Robotics Research Center at IIIT Hyderabad, advised by [Prof. K. Madhava Krishna](https://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/mkrishna/) and at IIT Gandhinagar, advised by [Prof. Shanmuga Raman](https://people.iitgn.ac.in/~shanmuga/).

<!-- In 2019, I was a Google Summer of Code ([GSoC](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/projects/6054863815835648/)) student for Open Robotics, where I worked on creating a documentation index for Gazebo. During my undergrad, I was also a part of my college's Autonomous Underwater Vehicle ([SRM-AUV](https://srmauvsoftware.github.io/)) team. -->

On the side, I dabbled with hosting the [Deep Neural Notebooks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKsk3K4Z-1AVwIzEi9pk-ayEh9uxdyweL) podcast, where I interviewed academics and scientists about their research, insights and journeys. Likewise, I also managed the [Humans of AI](https://humanstories.ai) podcast hosted by [Devi Parikh](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~parikh/) and [Dhruv Batra](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~dbatra/).
<!-- On the side, I have been a [technical writer and editor](https://www.scoutapm.com/blog/author/mukul-khanna) for the [ScoutAPM](https://www.scoutapm.com) software development [blog](https://www.scoutapm.com/blog). Alongside, I've also dabbled with hosting a data science podcast ([Deep Neural Notebooks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLKsk3K4Z-1AVwIzEi9pk-ayEh9uxdyweL)), where I interviewed academics and scientists about their research, insights and their journeys. I'm also interested in the ideas of [Zettelkasten](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOY-drtTJX0) knowledge management and briefly took to [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC66w1T4oMv66Jn1LR5CW2yg) to share my experiences (which happened to garner 80k views!). -->
